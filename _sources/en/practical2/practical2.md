# Practical Work 2

### Goals
1.  Implementation of Multilayer perceptron in Python
2. Analyses of texts
3. LSTM models

## Exercise 2.1
Implement the multi-layer Python perceptron with the following features
1. Configurable activation function
2. Configurable number of inputs 
3. Configurable number of epochs and training rates
4. Make predictions
5. Back-propagation

Test your model with simple functions.

## Exercise 2.2

Download an HTML page from the internet (e.g.,
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris>). Choose a long paragraph from the
page and perform the following operations

1.  Stemmming
2.  PoS Tagging
3.  Lemmatization
4.  Morphological analysis
5.  Named Entity Recognition
6.  Word embedding using Word2Vec models (CPOW and Skip-gram)

You can use one or more of the following packages, wherever possible. If
you are using more than two packages, also write a small comparative
report on your results.

1.  nltk
2.  spaCy
3.  gensim
4.  Tensorflow

## Exercise 2.3

### LSTM models
