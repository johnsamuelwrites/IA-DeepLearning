# Practical Work 2

**Academic year: 2022-2023**


### Goals
1.  Implementation of Multilayer perceptron in Python
2. LSTM models

## Exercise 2.1
Implement the multi-layer Python perceptron with the following features
1. Configurable activation function
2. Configurable number of inputs 
3. Configurable number of epochs and training rates
4. Make predictions
5. Back-propagation

Test your model with simple functions.

## Exercise 2.2
The following examples show how to work with the different tensorflow datasets and how to use classification using tensorflow deep neural networks.
 - [Data Processing in Tensorflow](../Project/Data.ipynb)
 - [Handwriting recognition using MNIST dataset](../Project/Introduction.ipynb)
 - [Text classification based on IMDB reviews](../Project/Texts.ipynb)

You have the following goals:
1. Change the datasets (using the available datasets from Tensorflow)
2. Change the hyperparameters (number of neurons, learning rate,...) and compare the classification reports.

## Exercise 2.3
### LSTM models

**Time Series Prediction with LSTM models**: Please check and run the
following code
<https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/>

Observe how sequences are generated in these examples.

## Exercise 2.4
Test the LSTM models to predict possible sequences of translations for the final exercise of the Mini Project.
 - [Understanding Property Translation of Wikidata](../Project/miniproject-notebook.ipynb)
