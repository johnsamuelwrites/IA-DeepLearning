# Practical Work 2

**Academic year: 2022-2023**


### Goals
1.  Implementation of Multilayer perceptron in Python
2. LSTM models

## Exercise 2.1
Implement the multi-layer Python perceptron with the following features
1. Configurable activation function
2. Configurable number of inputs 
3. Configurable number of epochs and training rates
4. Make predictions
5. Back-propagation

Test your model with simple functions.
